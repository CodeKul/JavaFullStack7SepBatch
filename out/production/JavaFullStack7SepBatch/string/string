- sequence of characters
- array of characters
- final class
- implements Serializable,Comparable,CharSequence,Constable, ConstantDesc

Ways to create a String
1. char[] ch = {'W','E','L','C','O','M','E'}

  --by using new keyword
2. String s = new String(ch);

  -- by using string literal
3. String s1 = "WELCOME";

String Pool Constant
- @ the time when we create a string literal, the JVM first checks the SPC.
	If the string is already exists in pool, a ref to the pooled instance is returned,
	otherwise a new string instance is created in pool.
	Only one object will be created

Immutable String
 - unmodifiable or unchangeable
 - state & data can not be changed

 String Compare
 1. By using equals() method
    - compares the content of string
 2. By using == operator
    - compares references not content
 3. By compareTo() method

 Notes:
 1. before Java 7, JVM string pool in PermGen space, which has a fixed size.
    so can not be expanded at runtime, & is not eligible for garbage collection
    we can get an OutOfMemoryError
 2  from Java 7, SCP is stored in Heap Area, which is garbage collected by JVM.
    reduced risk of  an OutOfMemoryError because unreferenced strings will be
    removed from the pool, thereby releasing memory
