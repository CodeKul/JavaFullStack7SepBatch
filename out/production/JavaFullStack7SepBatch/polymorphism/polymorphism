Method Overloading
- name of the method is same but different in arguments/parameters
- increase the readability of program

1. by changing number of args
2. by changing the data type

Notes:
	Method overloading is not possible by changing the return type
	of the method only

void add(int n1,int n2)
void add(int n1,int n2,int n3)
void add(float n1,int n2,int n3)
void add(double n1,int n2,int n3)

Method Overriding
- if child has the same method as declared in it's parent class
- method name must be same as method in parent class
- same parameters
- there must IS-A relationship

Homework
1. Can we overload the main method?
	- Yes
2. Can we override the main method?
	- No ,because main method is static
3. Difference between method overloading & method overriding

	Method Overloading                  	Method Overriding
1. method name is same                    1. method name is same
2. diff parameters                        2. same parameters
3. within class                           3. classes that have IS-A relationship
4. compile time polymorphism              4. run time polymorphism
5. can't be performed by changing         5. return type must be same
	the return type of the method

Polymorphism
- a single action in different ways
poly - many
morphs - forms
Types :
1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
2. Run-Time Polymorphism ( Dynamic Method Dispatch)
	- a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at
	runtime

Upcasting
- if the reference variable of parent class refers to object of child class
