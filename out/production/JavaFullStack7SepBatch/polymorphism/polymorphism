Method Overloading
- name of the method is same but different in arguments/parameters
- increase the readability of program

1. by changing number of args
2. by changing the data type

Notes:
	Method overloading is not possible by changing the return type
	of the method only

void add(int n1,int n2)
void add(int n1,int n2,int n3)
void add(float n1,int n2,int n3)
void add(double n1,int n2,int n3)

Method Overriding
- if child has the same method as declared in it's parent class
- method name must be same as method in parent class
- same parameters
- there must IS-A relationship

Homework
1. Can we overload the main method?
