Abstraction
- process of hiding the internal implementation details from the user & provides the user
with necessary information

2 ways to achieve abstraction
1. Abstract class(0-100%)
2. Interface(100%)

Abstract class
- stores the data members & methods

//Syntax
abstract class class_name{
	int pid;
	String name;
	abstract void show();
}
Rules:
1. an abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword
2. can have abstract % non-abstract method
3. cannot be instantiated
4.can have constructors & static
