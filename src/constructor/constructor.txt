- it is a block of code similar to the method
- when an instance of the class is created constructor gets called
- it constructs the values when the object is created
Types:
1. Default Constructor
	- no args constructor
	- doesn't have any parameter
2. Parametrised Constructor

Rules:
1. constructor name must be same as its class
2. constructor must have no explicit return type
3. constructor cannot be abstract, static,final & synchronised
4. if there is no constructor in a class, then compiler
 automatically provides a default constructor
