- to handle the runtime errors
Types
a) Built-In Exception
1. Checked Exception
	- compile time exception
	- IOException, SQLException
2. Unchecked Exception
	- run time exception

Error
 - irrecoverable




Throwable
	- Exception
		- IOException
		- SqlException
		- ClassNotFoundException
		- FileNotFoundException
		- RuntimeException
			- ArithmeticException
			- NullPointerException
			- IndexOutOfBoundException
			- NumberFormatException
	- Error
		- StackOverFlowError
		- OutOfMemoryError
		- VirtualMachineError

Reasons for exceptions:
1. Invalid user input
2. network connection error
3. Out of memory

1. try
	- place an exception code
	- must be followed by either catch or finally
2. catch
	- handle the exception
	- without try not allow
3. finally
	- to execute code like closing the connection
	- always executed whether exception is handled or not
	- eg. closing the file, closing database connection
	- only one finally block
4. throw
	- to throw an exception explicitly
	- can throw either checked or unchecked exception
5. throws
	- declare the exception
	- suppress the exception


	throw                           throws
1. used to throw an                declare the exception
   exception explicitly

2. can only propagate             can used to propagate checked &
   the unchecked exceptions       unchecked exception

3. within a method                with method signature

UserDefinedException:
class class_name extends Exception{
	class_name(String s){
	super(s);
	}
}

Exception Propagation
-


1. create user defined exception voteAgeCriteria
2. Difference between final, finally & finalize
