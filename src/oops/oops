OOPS Concepts:
- Object Oriented Programming
	eg. Java,C#,PHP,Python,C++
- to implement real world entities

1. Object
- real world entity
	eg. Pen,Computer,Laptop,Mobile,table,chair etc.
- instance of a class
- can be physical or logical
- contains an address so it consumes memory
- has states & behaviour
	eg. a) Dog
			states: color,name,breed
			behaviours: barking,eating,walking,running
		b) Mobile
			states: color,name,display,weight,OS,RAM,Camera
			behaviours: calling,video playing,ringing,vibrate
		c) Pen
			states: color,name,brand,height,type
			behaviours:writing

2. Class
- collection of objects
- logical entity
- blueprint
- doesn't consume any space

3. Inheritance
- when one object acquires all the properties(states) and behaviours of parent object

4. Polymorphism
- one task is performed in different ways
	eg. Cat speaks meow
		dog barks woof

5. Abstraction
- hiding internal details & showing only functionality to the end users
	eg. Washing machine, Microwave Oven

6. Encapsulation
- binding or wrapping code & data together into a single unit

7. Aggregation
