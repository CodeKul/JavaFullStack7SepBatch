- release 18 March 2014

Features:
1. forEach() method
	- Iterable interface

2. default & static methods in interface
	default method:
	- allow interface to have methods with implementation without affecting the classes
	that implement the interface
	- Default  methods are also known as Defender methods or virtual extension methods
	- provide backward compatibility so existing interfaces can use without implementing the
	default methods in the class
	static method:
	 - cannot be overridden & changed in the class
	 - part of interface only


3. Functional Interface & Lambda Expressions
	- an interface with exactly one abstract method
	- SAM(Single Abstract Method)interface
	- it is not mandatory to use annotation but we can use functional interface to avoid
	addition of extra abstract methods
	- benefit of java 8 functional interfaces is that we can use lambda expressions
	- used to refer method of functional interface
	eg. Runnable,ActionListener,Comparable,Callable

4. Method Reference
	- prerequisites are functional interface & lambda exp
	- we can replace lambda exp with method ref
	Types of Method References
	1. Reference to a static method
	2. Reference to an arbitrary object of a particular type
	3. Reference to a constructor
	4. Reference to an object/instance

5. Optional
	- it's a final class
	- to deal with NullPointerException
	- to avoid abnormal termination of application
	- java.util package

6. Stream API
	- from java.util.stream package
	- it does not store elements
	- to perform functional-style operations
    Features:
     1) Functional In Nature
     2) Laziness-seeking
     3) No storage
     4) Unbounded

7. Java Time API

8. Collection API improvement

9. Concurrency API improvement

8. I/O improvement

Base64
- java.util


Interfaces:
1. Consumer
2. BiConsumer
3. Function
	- Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result
	-  java.util.Objects
Homework:
1.
interface I1{
	default void display(){
		// lines of code
	}
}
interface I2{
	default void display(){
		// lines of code
	}
}
class TestInterface implements I1,I2{
	main(){
		//lines of code
	}
}

Addition of two nos using java 8

class Employee{
	name,
	id,
	salary

}
